# Hello There!👋
 I am preparing this solutions repo for helping others when they are trying to find the solution of their problems.
 I will push every solution that I can found as much as possible in languages as much as possible.
 I mainly use JavaScript and C but I also can code in Phyton, Java and Kotlin, too. Therefore, I am gonna try to put solutions in every language I have listed under here as much as possible.
